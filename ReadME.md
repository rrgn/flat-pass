# Flat Pass

## Overview

A web-based password manager that saves your data. Built using the MEAN stack, a user can create an account and "login" to access their stored information. Flat Pass does not use sessions / cookies / tokens and does not store the master password / key in the database, this is done by design so that only the user can have access to his information. If a wrong key is provided and an email is matched in the database, an error is provided but the data tied to that email address is still not returned, thus simulating a "login".

* User data is encrypted using the node module crypto, which converts the user data into one long string of random text.
* The master password / key is used to decrypt the user data that is stored in the database, and displays the decrypted data on the page
* An add account button is used to add more logins for that specific user, and all the data is encrypted again before being stored in the database.
* A nuke button is provided to erase the user data on the page, but does not affect the information stored in the database.
